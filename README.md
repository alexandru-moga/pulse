# ðŸš€ Deploy using XAMPP

This guide will help you set up the Pulse PHP project on your own computer using **XAMPP** and **phpMyAdmin**.  
Just follow these steps to get your local development environment running!

---

## 1. Install XAMPP

- Download XAMPP from [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- Run the installer and follow the prompts (default settings are fine).
- Open the **XAMPP Control Panel** and click **Start** for both **Apache** and **MySQL**.

---

## 2. Copy Pulse Files to XAMPP

- Find your XAMPP installation directory (usually `C:\xampp` on Windows).
- Open the `htdocs` folder inside XAMPP.
- Copy all Pulse project files and folders into `C:\xampp\htdocs\pulse`
  - Your structure should look like:
    ```
    C:\xampp\htdocs\pulse\
        index.php
        core/
        components/
        css/
        ...etc.
    ```

---

## 3. Create a Database Using phpMyAdmin

- In your browser, go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
- Click the **Databases** tab at the top.
- Enter a name for your database, e.g. `pulse`
- Click **Create**

---

## 4. Import the Database Schema

- With your new database selected in phpMyAdmin, click the **Import** tab.
- Click **Browse** and select the `pulse.sql` file from the Pulse project (download from GitHub if needed).
- Click **Go** to import the database structure and initial data.

---

## 5. Access website
- You can access pulse by going to [http://localhost/pulse](http://localhost/pulse)

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Database connection errors:** Database credentials detaults are set for XAMPP. If you want to change database name, user, password or host you have to modify .env file.

---

## Usage

- **Admin Dashboard:**
- Default credentials are:
    User: admin@example.com
    Password: pulse
- Create, edit, and delete pages and content blocks.
- Only pages with a non-empty `table_name` are editable for blocks.
- **Members:**  
- Users' GitHub avatars are shown if their GitHub username is set.
- **Blocks:**  
- Each page with a `table_name` has its own MySQL table for blocks (e.g., `page_members`).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid page or block ID":**  
  Make sure your URLs use `?id=...` and `&block_id=...` and that the IDs exist in your database.

- **GitHub Avatars not showing:**  
  Ensure the userâ€™s `github_username` is set in the database.

- **PHP Deprecated/Warning:**  
  Always cast possible `null` values to string before using functions like `trim()`.

- **Permission errors:**  
  Make sure PHP has write access to the `public` directory for dynamic page creation.

- **Git Pull Errors:**  
  If you get a message about local changes, commit or stash your changes before pulling:
```
git stash
```

## Component System Migration (2025)

Pulse has been migrated from the old component system to a new drag-and-drop component architecture. All legacy components have been successfully migrated.

### Migration Summary

**Migrated Components:**
- `components/old-components/` â†’ `components/templates/`
- Updated all component type names from kebab-case to snake_case (e.g., `title-3` â†’ `title_3`)
- All page data tables (`page_apply`, `page_contact`, `page_index`, `page_members`) updated to use new component types

**New Component System Features:**
- Drag-and-drop interface in dashboard
- Standardized template structure in `components/templates/`
- Centralized component management via `ComponentManager.php`
- Backward compatibility maintained through `PageManager.php`

**Legacy Components Archived:**
- Old components moved to `components/archived-components/` for reference
- New component templates created for all migrated components
- Database schema updated with new component types
