  - Host, Username, Password: copy from your FTP Details in InfinityFree
- Connect and upload all Pulse files and folders (including `/install`) to the `htdocs` directory

---

## 5. Run the Installer

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Database connection errors:** Double-check your host, database name, user, and password in InfinityFreeâ€™s MySQL Databases page.
- **Installer not found:** Make sure you uploaded all files to the `htdocs` directory.
- **File permissions:** InfinityFree sets these automatically; you usually donâ€™t need to change them.

## Usage

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
- Create, edit, and delete pages and content blocks.
- Only pages with a non-empty `table_name` are editable for blocks.
- **Members:**  
- Users' GitHub avatars are shown if their GitHub username is set.
- **Blocks:**  
- Each page with a `table_name` has its own MySQL table for blocks (e.g., `page_members`).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid page or block ID":**  
  Make sure your URLs use `?id=...` and `&block_id=...` and that the IDs exist in your database.

- **GitHub Avatars not showing:**  
  Ensure the userâ€™s `github_username` is set in the database.

- **PHP Deprecated/Warning:**  
  Always cast possible `null` values to string before using functions like `trim()`.

- **Permission errors:**  
  Make sure PHP has write access to the `public` directory for dynamic page creation.

- **Git Pull Errors:**  
  If you get a message about local changes, commit or stash your changes before pulling:
```
git stash
```
